                        <p>Hi I am Khemraj Thapa, currently living in Sandhurst, UK. I have recently graduate from University of Portsmouth with BSc (Hons) Computing. I aspire to become a web developer, as I have always been keen and curious about computer and websites since my childhood days. I am passionate about both front-end and back-end development. I am currently learning web development skills like PHP, JavaScript, Wordpress and much more from website like Treehouse and Codeacademy. </p>
                        <p>While I am not coding, I enjoy watching various sports and am avid fan of <em>Liverpool FC</em>. I also like listening music and reading novels. I also have interest in History and am always curious about, how big is our universe and if we are alone in this humongous universe. Crazy stuffs, I know.</p>
